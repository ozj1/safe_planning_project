% use separating axis test to check whether rectangles are intersecting
%  - convex polygons do not intersecting if they can be separated by a
%  straight line, i.e. all vertices of the poligons are on different sides of  
%  the line.  Furthermore, if the rectangles don't overlap one of the edges 
%  will be such a separating axis.
%    => check if one of the eight edges separates the two rectangles. Use 
%    sign of dot product to check on which side of the line the vertices are 
%  see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/115426/algorithm-to-detect-intersection-of-two-rectangles
